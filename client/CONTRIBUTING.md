# Contributing on GitHub
## Issues
Please log an issue if you find anything wrong with the app.
I suggest doing this even if you plan on immediately fixing the issue and making a PR.
This way, you have support if you run into any blockers on your own.

## Pull Requests
Feel free to pull or fork this project and add modifications.
If you do so, you can create a pull request to the `master` branch, or another WiP branch.
@noltron000 will review it and consider your changes!

# Clean Git Practices
## Name your Branches!
If you plan on contributing, please name your branches as follows: <kbd>\<TAG\>/\<BRANCH_NAME\></kbd>
The branch must be named using kabab-case.

The tag must exist, and can be any one of the following:
- bugfix
- documentation
- enhancement
- feature

For example, these are good branch names:
- <kbd>bugfix/navbar</kbd>
- <kbd>enhancement/api-data</kbd>
- <kbd>feature/login</kbd>
- <kbd>documentation/filter-results</kbd>

The project has a couple of exceptions.
- <kbd>master</kbd>
- <kbd>dev</kbd>

## Use Merge Commits
This repo prefers merge-commits to squashing or rebasing, within the main project branches (dev, master, etc).
Just use common sense if you feel squashing or rebasing would be cleaner between your personal branches.
